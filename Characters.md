# Characters

This entire project is inspired by KONAMI's "Quiz Magic Academy" series, so feel free to translate [this page](https://p.eagate.573.jp/game/qma/18/world/index.html) for ideas. Do not have blatant 1:1 copies of QMA characters.
The age field will be removed once I decide to commission artwork for each of the characters.
