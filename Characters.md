# Characters

This entire project is inspired by KONAMI's "Quiz Magic Academy" series, so feel free to translate [this page](https://p.eagate.573.jp/game/qma/18/world/index.html) for ideas. Do not have blatant 1:1 copies of QMA characters.
The age field will be removed once I decide to commission artwork for each of the characters.

## Students

The following is how all students should be listed here:

- Name

  - Physical appearance description, alongside personality and other facts about the character. Don't go too deep, leave that for the actual story. Keep the personality and other facts as concise as the QMA character bios, linked above.
